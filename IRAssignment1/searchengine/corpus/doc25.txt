Summary 
Materials management can deal with campus planning and building design for the movement of materials, or with logistics that deal with the tangible components of a supply chain. Specifically, this covers the acquisition of spare parts and replacements, quality control of purchasing and ordering such parts, and the standards involved in ordering, shipping, and warehousing the said parts.
Materials management is the function responsible for the coordination of planning, sourcing, purchasing, moving, storing and controlling materials in an optimum manner in order to provide a pre decided service to the customer at a minimum cost.
